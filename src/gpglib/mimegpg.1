.SH NAME
make \- MIME-GPG utility
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBmimegpg\fR [ \fB-s\fR ] [ \fB-E\fR ] [ \fB-e\fR ] [ \fB-c\fR ] [ \fB-d\fR ] [ \fB-p \fIn\fB\fR ] \fB--\fR \fBgpg options\fR\fI ...\fR

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The \fBmimegpg\fR tool signs, encrypts, or decrypts MIME-formatted E-mail
messages using GnuPG. \fBmimegpg\fR does not contain any encryption code. It
uses the GnuPG utility for all encryption and decryption functions.
.PP
The \fB-s\fR option signs an E-mail message. The \fB-E\fR or
the \fB-e\fR option encrypts the E-mail message. Specifying both
\fB-E/-e\fR and \fB-s\fR encrypts and signs the E-mail message
in a single step. The \fB-d\fR option decrypts the message. The
\fB-c\fR option checks signatures.
.PP
\fBmimegpg\fR works as a filter.  It reads an E-mail message from
standard input, which must be a MIME-formatted message. \fBmimegpg\fR signs,
encrypts, and/or decrypts the message; then writes the encrypted, signed, or
decrypted MIME message on standard output.
.PP
The standard input to \fBmimegpg\fR must be a MIME E-mail message, with a
"Mime Version: 1.0" header - even if the message does not contain any
attachments.  If the message contains any attachments, they are also signed
and/or encrypted, individually.
.PP
\fBmimegpg\fR automatically runs GnuPG, with the required options.
\fBmimegpg\fR's options may also be followed by a single --
option; any remaining command line options are passed as additional options
to GnuPG. The \fB-E/-e\fR option usually requires at least one
\fB-r\fR GnuPG option, which may be specified in this fashion.
.PP
The \fB-p\fR option specifies a file descriptor that contains any
required passphrase. Any other valid GnuPG options may follow a double-dash,
"--", as long as it makes sense for this operation (note that \fBmimegpg\fR
automatically adds any GnuPG options that are needed to perform the given
operation). The "--no-tty" option can be useful when \fBmimegpg\fR is
used in a non-interactive mode.  As always, secret keys that are
password-protected secret keys cannot be used in the \fB--no-tty\fR
mode, unless the \fB-p\fR option is used.
.SS "SIGNING AND ENCRYPTING MESSAGES"
.PP
Use the \fB-s\fR option to sign MIME message content. Use the
\fB-E\fR option to encrypt it. Use both options to both sign and
encrypt. Follow with --, then any other GnuPG options. The
\fB-E\fR option will require at least one \fB-r\fR GnuPG
option.
.PP
The \fB-E\fR option encapsulates the message content and all the
attachments into a single encrypted MIME object. Some mail software cannot
handle encapsulated content. The \fB-e\fR option encrypts each
attachment separately, without encapsulation.
.PP
If a secret key used for signing is password protected, the prompt to
enter the password will be issued directly by GnuPG. Note that the
\fB-s\fR and the \fB-e\fR (but not \fB-E\fR) options may
issue multiple password prompts in interactive mode. \fBmimegpg\fR runs
GnuPG multiple times if the MIME message contains attachments.  GnuPG will be
invoked separately for each attachment in the MIME message, and each
invocation will prompt for any required key password.  Note that the initial
message headers are not signed and/or encrypted, except for the MIME headers
themselves.  However, any message/rfc822 MIME content - attached
messages - are encrypted/signed in their entirety, headers and content.
.SS "DECRYPTING AND CHECKING SIGNATURES"
.PP
The \fB-d\fR option attempts to decrypt any encrypted content in a
MIME message.  The \fB-c\fR option attempts to verify signatures of
any signed content.  Both \fB-c\fR and \fB-d\fR
can be specified at the
same time. \fB-d\fR looks for any multipart/encrypted
MIME content, then attempts to decrypt it. \fB-c\fR looks for any
multipart/signed MIME content, then attempts to verify the
signature.
.PP
The \fB-c\fR and \fB-d\fR options replace the
multipart/signed and multipart/encrypted MIME
content with a multipart/x-mimepgp section, that contains an
additional attribute called "xpgpstatus". The value of the attribute is set
to the exit code of GnuPG. Succesfully decrypting the message and/or
verifying the signature sets the exit code to 0. A non-zero exit code
indicates that the signature could not be verified, or the message could not
be decrypted.
.PP
The first section in this multipart/x-mimepgp is a
text/plain section that contains any messages from GnuPG. The
second section is any decrypted or signed content. \fBmimegpg\fR will
include the signed content even if the signature could not be verified (check
xpgpstatus). Encrypted content that could not be decrypted will
not be included (obviously).
.PP
Note - any existing x-mimegpg MIME section will have its content-type
quietly reset to multipart/mixed, in order to avoid confusion (except when
this is what got decrypted).
